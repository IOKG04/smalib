More functions will (maybe) be added over time, so it can (maybe) become mediumlib.

### Usage conditions / License

There are none, a small notice saying where you got the code would be nice, but you can effectively treat this like a stackoverflow comment.

### Contributing

Add stuff on your branch, make a pull request and I'll see if I'll add it.  
What did you expect?
